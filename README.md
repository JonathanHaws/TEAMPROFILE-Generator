# Team Profile Generator

## Description
A command line app that will generate html and css files with your team. Download this repo and install Node 16. In the repo folder's terminal run npm install to get all the package.json dependecies like inquirer and jest. Run the program with node index.js and answer the series of prompts. Once done the files will be created inside the dist folder for your own use. An example html and css come included in the dist folder but will be overwritten once you make your own.
